      <h2>COVID-19 Resources</h2>
      <h3>Our Commitment to Health & Safety</h3>
        <p>SACC is committed to protecting the health of our children, families, staff, and community.
        The following policies were designed in response to guidance from the Michigan Departments
        of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA) and Health and Human Services, in accordance
        with best practices from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and with everyone's
        well-being in mind. To limit the potential spread of COVID-19, we will be making some
        temporary changes to our programming that include robust cleaning and disinfecting
        procedures and minimizing opportunities for person-to-person exposure (e.g., an infected
        person spreading respiratory droplets through actions such as coughing, sneezing, or talking).
        The following plan outlines the recommended practices and strategies will use to protect the
        health of our children, staff, and families while at the same time ensuring that children are
        experiencing developmentally appropriate and responsive interactions and environments.
