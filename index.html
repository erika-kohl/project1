      <h2>About</h2>
      <br>
    <p>
      Welcome to Chippewa Valley Schools (CVS), School Age Child Care (S.A.C.C.) Program!
      Our mission is to provide a safe and friendly supervised environment, encouraging children
      to enhance their social/emotional, physical, and cognitive development through a wide range
      of age-appropriate activities. Children will be provided with the opportunity to participate
      in activities that are both self and staff-directed or initiated.
    </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Childcare Goals</h3>
      
      <p class="list">The School Age Child Care Program strives to provide the following:</p>
      <br>

        <li>A nurturing environment for all children.</li>
