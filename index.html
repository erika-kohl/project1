      <h2>About</h2>
      <br>
    <p>
      Welcome to Chippewa Valley Schools (CVS), School Age Child Care (S.A.C.C.) Program!
      Our mission is to provide a safe and friendly supervised environment, encouraging children
      to enhance their social/emotional, physical, and cognitive development through a wide range
      of age-appropriate activities. Children will be provided with the opportunity to participate
      in activities that are both self and staff-directed or initiated.
    </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Childcare Goals</h3>
      
      <p><b>The School Age Child Care Program strives to provide the following:</b></p>
      <br>
      <ul  class="list" >
        <li>A safe, healthy environment where staff strive to meet the emotional, social, and physical needs of the children.</li>
        <li>A nurturing environment for all children.</li>
        <li>Respect for self and others, while responsibilities and social skills are both enhanced and encouraged.</li> 
        <li>A safe place for children to socialize with peers.</li>
        <li>Planned and supervised activities before and after school, including arts and crafts, science, and math activities.</li>
        <li>Indoor and outdoor physical activities that provide children the opportunity to play and work as a team, while getting exercise.</li>
      </ul> <!-- Source: https://www.chippewavalleyschools.org/for-parents/sacc/-->

      <h3>Days of Operation</h3>
      <p>
        SACC is available Monday–Friday, in accordance with the District calendar. SACC program hours vary at each site. Please see school website for hours of operation.
        To attend SACC, your child must be present in school and come to SACC from school. We cannot accept children who are dropped off at a later time or did not attend school that day.
        SACC may be available on Early Release days, Half Days, and may be available during school
        breaks at select schools. Please check with your Program Director for availability. Advance
        sign up is required for ALL afterschool care.
      </p>

      <br>

     <h3> Arrival and Departure</h3>
    <p>
      CVS District policy mandates for the safety and security of the children, all entrances to
      elementary buildings are locked.
      The SACC entrance is equipped with an intercom system. When you arrive, please press the
      SACC intercom button located to the right of the door and identify yourself. Staff will
      unlock the door to let you in. Please have photo ID available when entering the building.
      Children will NOT be released to persons that are not listed on the Child Information Form.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Checking In/Out of Childcare</h3>
    <p>
      For your child’s safety, the SACC program and the State of Michigan require that an adult
      must accompany children into the building and check them into the program. SACC utilizes
      a computerized attendance program, in which authorized people listed on the Emergency
      Information Record are assigned an account number for checking in/out of the program.
      Children will only be released to persons listed on the Child Information Record with a
      valid picture I.D.
      *Failure to clock your child(ren) out could result in charges for a full day.   
    </p>
